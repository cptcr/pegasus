## üìù Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

We use TypeScript for all code. Please follow these guidelines:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings (except to avoid escaping)
- Use `const` by default, `let` when reassignment is needed, never `var`
- Prefer arrow functions over function expressions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and complex logic

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Calculates user XP for the next level
 * @param currentLevel - The user's current level
 * @param baseXP - The base XP required for level 1
 * @returns The XP required for the next level
 */
const calculateNextLevelXP = (currentLevel: number, baseXP: number): number => {
  return baseXP * Math.pow(1.5, currentLevel);
};
```

### File Structure

- Commands go in `src/commands/{category}/{commandName}.ts`
- Event handlers go in `src/events/{eventName}.ts`
- Utility functions go in `src/utils/{utilityName}.ts`
- Database schemas go in `src/database/schema/{schemaName}.ts`
- Services go in `src/services/{serviceName}.ts`

### Internationalization (i18n)

All user-facing strings must support internationalization:

```typescript
// Good
await interaction.reply(i18n.t('commands.xp.rank.response', { 
  level: userLevel, 
  xp: currentXP 
}));

// Bad
await interaction.reply(`You are level ${userLevel} with ${currentXP} XP!`);
```

Remember to add translations for all supported languages:
- English (en)
- German (de)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)

## üì§ Commit Guidelines
