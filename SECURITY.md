## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

When using Pegasus, please follow these security best practices:

### Bot Token Security

- **Never commit your bot token** to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Rotate your token immediately if exposed
- Use different tokens for development and production

### Database Security

- **Use strong passwords** for your PostgreSQL database
- **Restrict database access** to only necessary hosts
- **Enable SSL/TLS** for database connections in production
- **Regular backups** of your database
- **Keep PostgreSQL updated** with security patches

### Permission Management

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant the bot permissions it needs
- **Regular Audits**: Review bot permissions periodically
- **Role Hierarchy**: Ensure the bot's role is positioned correctly
- **Command Permissions**: Use Discord's built-in command permissions

### Configuration Security

```env
# Good - Using environment variables
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/db

# Bad - Hardcoding in source files
const token = "MTE2MzU4..." // Never do this!
```

### Secure Deployment

1. **Use HTTPS** for any web interfaces or APIs
2. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
3. **Use a process manager** like PM2 with proper restart policies
4. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse
5. **Monitor logs** for suspicious activity
6. **Use a firewall** to restrict unnecessary ports
